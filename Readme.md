# Just some SlackBuilds

I tweaked most of them, none written from scratch. If you find them useful, yay!

The Trezor-Bridge Slackbuild is trash, need to add:
	- User and group for trezor to run daemon
	- Add daemon in rc.d scripts
	- Add checks in Slackbuild to check for user and group
But as of now, it works, just run trezord when needed and kill it when done.
